# menu-filtering
Practice project made with React Js and React Hooks

This is my version of the Accordion project in ['Code 15 React Projects' course by John Smilga](https://youtu.be/a_7Z7C_JCyo).

### Overview and learnings
Menu Filtering is a simple menu display with a simple dynamic filtering system.

The main React functionality I learned is how to create filters dynamically. I made my own setup, styling and added an extra pagination feature to the original idea of the project.
